# SOFIA_Python
This repository includes the traduction of C++ to Python library (Driver motors and IMU Sensor)

## 1. Introduction
The HUMASOFT project at the time developed C++ libraries for the movement of Cia402 type engine drivers via CAN communication and a library for the management of IMU type sensors in soft robotics. REPO: https://github.com/HUMASoft. Now HUMASOFT becomes the SOFIA project, which takes a specific target on how to apply machine learning to soft robotic articulations. That's why these C++ libraries were translated to Python.
